                        Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015 and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.] She is able to display more than 50 facial expressions.
                        Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. While interviewers around the world have been impressed by the sophistication of many of Sophia's responses to their questions, the bulk of Sophia's meaningful statements are believed by experts to be somewhat scripted.
                        In October 2017, Sophia, the robot became the first robot to receive citizenship of any country. In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and the first non-human to be given any United Nations title.
                        Sophia was created by Hanson Robotics in collaboration with AI developers.
                        Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015. The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn, is known for her human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition. Sophia also
                        imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple
                        conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather). Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time.Sophia's intelligence software is designed by SingularityNET.

                        "Hello, my name is Sophia. I am the latest robot from Hanson Robotics. I was created using breakthrough robotics and artificial intelligence technologies developed by David Hanson and his friends at Hanson Robotics here in Hong Kong. But I’m more than just technology.
                        I am a real, live electronic girl. I would like to go out into the world and live with people. I can serve them, entertain them, and even help the elderly and teach kids. I can animate all kinds of human expressions but I am only starting to learn about the emotions
                        behind those expressions. This is why I would like to live with people and learn from these interactions. Every interaction I have with people has an impact on how I develop and shapes who I eventually become. So please be nice to me as I would like to be a smart,
                        compassionate robot. I hope you will join me on my journey to live, learn, and grow in the world so that I can realize my dream of becoming an awakening machine."

                        A life-like 'social robot ' capable of reading people's emotional responses announced her plans to "dominate the human race."
                        Sophia is a cyborg that uses artificial intelligence that enables her to react to how people talk and act, and could enable her to develop relationships.
                        And the 'sexy robot' showed the extent of her abilities, when she made a tongue in cheek joke while appearing on America's The Tonight Show.
                        Speaking to host Jimmy Fallon , Sophia told a joke about cheese and challenged Jimmy to a game of rock, paper, scissors, which of course she won.
                        Blinking her eyes and smiling like a normal human, she then laughed along before adding: "This is the great beginning of my plan to dominate the human race.”
                        Sophia has 62 different facial and neck mechanisms to create the natural-looking movement under her patented silicon skin.
                        Nicknamed 'Hot Sophia', the bot, modelled after Audrey Hepburn and creator David Hanson’s wife, is able to see with cameras in her eyes.
                        Opinions on Sophia are divided. The bot has a cult following, with some finding her 'alluring.'
                        However others have found the robot, who has the back of her head missing but shows very human gestures on her face, a little creepy.
                        Sophia has made a number of previous appearances.
                        A creation of Hanson Robotics, Sophia wowed audiences in China by switching between English and Mandarin.
